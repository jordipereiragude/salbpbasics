## SALBP basics

Simple code for the SALBP.

The code provides:

- Reader for .in2 file format
- A greedy heuristic for the SALBP-1
- An implementation of the Hoffmann heuristic for the SALBP-1 
- A local search implementation for the SALBP-2 exploring the move and swap neighborhood.

The code is used for education purposes and lacks many features. Use at your own risk.
